# ball-reactions-to-slope
With a ball angle and a slope angle, the code gives appropriate angles after the ball hits the slope.

## Initial attempt
From the https://www.twitch.tv/cmgriffing channel, he was laying out expectations for how the golf ball is affected when it contacts a slope.
An initial attempt was with http://jsfiddle.net/pmw57/cnrqvzt1/6/ which converted angles to x,y coordinates, and solved for the hypotenuse before converting back to an angle. It was only partly successful though.

## Successful code
After simplifying things and using polar coordinates instead (magnitude, angle), full success was achieved in the code at http://jsfiddle.net/pmw57/cnrqvzt1/105/
